# ESPspectrum-V1.1
ESPspectrum is a small computer based on ESP32 microcontroller. The project was inspired by the ZX Spectrum computer. USB-keyboard, SD-card module and VGA-monitor are connected to the device.
It is programmed in the Arduino IDE environment. 

The operating system is not the same as in ZX Spectrum (you can change, create or modify something in the operating system, add your own, perhaps completely new). You can connect external modules and sensors if you want.  


This repository contains firmware version 1.1. It has functions for working with files from SD-card, calculator, games, free print (for various tests). 
Control is very simple: with cvr in menus and WASD keys in games.
Erase - Esc, exit - end, line translation (enter) - enter.


How to compile

1.Install Arduino IDE
